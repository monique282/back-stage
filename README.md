- `dotenv`
- `errors`
- `express`
- `express-async-errors`
- `http-status`

### Commands to Run the Project


To use a mock API and to access the data that will feed the project and run it, do the following:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your machine: [https://github.com/monique282/back-stage](https://github.com/monique282/back-stage);
2. In another terminal, run the `npm install` command to install all libraries.
3. Take `.env.example` as an example to create the .env file. Add them to your local `.env` file
4. Use the .env.example file to create the .env .
5. Then run the command `npm run dev:migration:generate`, which will create the tables and upload all the data
6. Run the `npm run dev` command to run the project. This command provides a link that you can open in your browser to interact with the project.

```
Remembering, all the commands above must be given in the folder that corresponds to the project.
For the complete project to work you need Front-end too, which is in the repository: https://github.com/monique282/front-stage
```
